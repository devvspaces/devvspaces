### Hi! Iâ€™m Ayomide ðŸ‘‹ I'm a Senior Software Engineer!

I've had the incredible opportunity to build amazing things. I've helped companies boost performance - we're talking 40% faster database queries, 30% reduced assessment processing times, and creating systems with 99.999% uptime.

But tech isn't just my job - it's my passion. When I'm not coding, you'll find me exploring blockchain technologies, contributing to open-source projects, or diving into video games. I've even developed my own projects like a blockchain explorer and an educational NFT minting platform.

I'm a big fan of writing, creating videos, and teaching. Whether it's mentoring junior developers or exploring new tech frontiers, I'm all about growth and innovation.

I enjoy teaching in public through the 40,672 words Iâ€™ve written on [blog.bloombyte.dev](https://blog.bloombyte.dev/).
